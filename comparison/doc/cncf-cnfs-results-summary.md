## NFV Service Density Benchmarking

## Introduction

This note describes the benchmarking of VNF and CNF based software-based
network services running on a single compute node, referred to as NFV
service density benchmarking. FD.io VPP is used as the open-source
Network Function (NF). NF(s) are running either within the VM(s),
referred to as VNF(s), or within the Docker Container(s), referred to as
CNF(s). Ethernet frames are demultiplexed and multiplexed from/to the
two physical 10GbE interfaces thru a Linux User-Mode Software Switch
using FD.io VPP again.

The same version of FD.io VPP application running in VNFs and CNFs are
configured as a IPv4 routing Network Fuction, routed-forwarding between
two (virtual)software interfaces, virtio in VNFs and memif in CNFs.

The same version of FD.io VPP application, running Linux User-Mode as a
(virtual) software Switch, is configured as a Ethernet L2 Bridge with
in-line dataplane MAC learning, L2 switched-forwarding between multiple
(virtual) software interfaces, vhostuser for inter-connected VNFs and
memif for inter-connected CNFs.

## Cores Allocation

### Linux User-Mode Switch

A single instance of Linux User-Mode Software (SW) Switch is running in
a compute node. Every performance optimized SW Switch application has
two sets of software threads: i) Main threads, handling Switch
application management and control planes, and ii) Dataplane threads,
handling dataplane packet processing and forwarding.

This applies to FD.io VPP used in this benchmarking.

Allocation of processor physical cores to the software switch is as
follows:

1. Two mapping ratios are defined and used in software switch
   benchmarking:
   * `pcdr4sw` value determines Physical Core to Dataplane Ratio for SWitch.
   * `pcmr4sw` value determines Physical Core to Main Ratio for SWitch.
2. Target values to be benchmarked:
   * pcdr4sw = [(1:1),(2:1),(4:1)].
   * pcmr4sw = [(1:1),(1:2)].
3. Number of physical cores required for the benchmarked software switch
   is calculated as follows:
   *     #pc = pcdr4sw * #dsw + pcmr4sw * #msw
   * where
   *     #pc - total number of physical cores required and used.
   *     #dsw - total number of switch dataplane thread sets (1 set per SW switch).
   *     #msw - total number of switch main thread sets (1 set per SW switch).

### CNFs and VNFs

Multiple instances of NFs (CNFs or VNFs) are running in a compute node.
Every performance optimized NF has two sets of software threads: i) Main
threads, handling NF application management and control planes, and ii)
Dataplane threads, handling NF dataplane packet processing and
forwarding.

This applies to FD.io VPP used in this benchmarking.

Allocation of processor physical cores per NF instance is as
follows:

1. Two mapping ratios are defined and used in NF service matrix
   benchmarking:
   a. `pcdr4nf` value determines Physical Core to Dataplane Ratio for NF.
   b. `pcmr4nf` value determines Physical Core to Main Ratio for NF.
2. Target values to be benchmarked:
   a. pcdr4nf = [(1:1),(1:2),(1:4)].
   b. pcmr4nf = [(1:2),(1:4),(1:8)].
3. Number of physical cores required for the benchmarked NFs' service
   matrix is calculated as follows:
   *     #pc = pcdr4nf * #dnf + pcmr4nf * #mnf
   * where
   *     #pc  - total number of physical cores required and used.
   *     #dnf - total number of NF dataplane thread sets (1 set per NF instance).
   *     #mnf - total number of NF main thread sets (1 set per per NF instance).

## Methodology - MRR Throughput

MRR tests measure the packet forwarding rate under the maximum load
offered by traffic generator over a set trial duration, regardless of
packet loss. Maximum load for specified Ethernet frame size is set to
the bi-directional link rate.

## Service Density Matrix – MRR Throughput Results (L2 size=64B)

* Maximum Receive Rate (MRR) throughput results is measured in [Mpps]
* [Mpps] mega (millions) packets-per-second
* Encapsulation: IPv4 over untagged Ethernet
* IPv4 size: 46 Bytes
* Ethernet frame size: 64 Bytes

## Reading nfvbench logs

Throughput results generated by nfvbench are stored in following directories:

1. pcdr4sw = (1:1)
  * ```cnfs/comparison/baseline_nf_performance-csit/results/2t1c_novlan```
2. pcdr4sw = (2:1)
  * ```cnfs/comparison/baseline_nf_performance-csit/results/4t2c_novlan```

Pretty one-liner printouts per test can be obtained using ```jq``` json
parser and following commands run within the above results' directories:

```
jq -r '.benchmarks.network.service_chain.EXT.result.result."64".run_config."direction-total".rx | "64B \(.rate_pps)pps (\(.rate_bps)bps) " + input_filename' *pps*.json
```
```
jq -r '.benchmarks.network.service_chain.EXT.result.result.IMIX.run_config."direction-total".rx | "64B \(.rate_pps)pps (\(.rate_bps)bps) " + input_filename' *pps*.json
```
